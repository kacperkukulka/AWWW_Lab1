# FootballAspNetMVC
Project to manage database

An interesting solution in this project is my universal View which can be used by just copying it to another view folder and all views including "Add, Edit, Delete, View" will work on a model.
I also created a universal Controller to work with basic model without any relationship. There's then no need to put any code in this controller.
